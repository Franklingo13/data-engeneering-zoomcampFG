# Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

Module 1 homework answers (Docker + SQL) live in the `pipeline/` folder. To reproduce or inspect them:
1) Spin up PostgreSQL and pgAdmin with `docker-compose` inside `pipeline/`.
2) Ingest the November 2025 green taxi data with `ingest_data_HW.py` (see comments in the file for options).
3) The answers and the SQL queries used are documented in [pipeline/Homework.md](pipeline/Homework.md).
